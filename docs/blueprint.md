## Style Guidelines:

- **Theme:** A dark, futuristic, and sophisticated theme. "Glassmorphism" will be used to create a sense of depth and transparency.
- **Primary Color:** A vibrant purple (`#8A2BE2`) to evoke creativity and introspection.
- **Secondary Color:** A cool cyan (`#00FFFF`) as an accent for interactive elements and highlights.
- **Background:** A dark, animated background with subtle, glowing particles to create a dynamic and immersive experience. I'll use a three.js background for this.
- **Fonts:**
    - **Headers:** A modern, geometric sans-serif font like 'Orbitron' for a futuristic feel.
    - **Body:** A clean and readable sans-serif font like 'Roboto' for the body text.
- **Icons:** Sleek, minimalist icons from a library like `lucide-react`.
- **Animations:**
    - **Text Scramble Effect:** Use a text scramble effect for titles and headings to add a dynamic, digital feel.
    - **Hover Effects:** On hover, interactive elements will have a subtle glow and a slight scale transform to provide feedback.
