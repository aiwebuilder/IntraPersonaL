/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for AURA+ application.
 * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user-generated data and allows public read access to the topics collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/topics/{topicId}`: Publicly readable collection of available topics.
 * - `/users/{userId}/speechAnalyses/{speechAnalysisId}`: Collection of speech analysis data owned by a specific user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/questions/{questionId}`: Collection of AI-generated questions for a specific user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/answers/{answerId}`: Collection of user answers to questions, owned by a specific user.
 * - `/users/{userId}/reports/{reportId}`: Collection of AI-generated reports owned by a specific user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly segregated under `/users/{userId}` to enforce ownership.
 * - Listing of user documents is allowed only to the owner.
 * - Topics are publicly readable.
 *
 * Authorization:
 * - Data ownership is determined by the path: `/users/{userId}/...`. The authenticated user's UID must match the `userId` path segment.
